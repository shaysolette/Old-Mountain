<p>Old Mountain is a novel being written by Shay Solette for National Novel Writing Month.  It will be his first
novel. This novel will be written in one month, starting on 1 November 2014, and ending on 30 November 2014.
Old Mountain is set in a gritty, low fantasy world, and is inspired by old western movies. The protagonist is
a lone bounty hunter who must join forces with a rival in order to track down and apprehend the most wanted
man in the outer territories.</p>

<p>In order to survive in the hostile and unpredictable wilderness surrounding the town of Old Mountain, and
gain the trust of it's natives, he must overcome his own prejudices, and deal with the demons of his past, all
while struggling to cope with a reluctant new partner, who he is not sure if he can trust. Success will mean
food on his plate for one more day.  Failure will mean death.</p>
