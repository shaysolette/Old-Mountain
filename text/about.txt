<p>I decided to write this novel after having a challenge issued to me by one of my close friends, a trained
writer with an English degree, who first told me about National Novel Writing Month last year. Prior to
beginning this novel, the only previous writing I have done has been song lyrics, poetry, and writing for
tabletop and PC games that I enjoy designing; things like plot, level design, and NPC dialog, although I feel
like still suck at dialog.</p>

<p>When I am not writing, I am either playing music, or designing and programing games.  I have been playing
guitar for over 15 years, and I dabble in several other instruments.  I write my own music, and have recorded
and performed with several rock bands. I have a passion for many styles of music, as diverse as metal, blues,
jazz, new wave, funk, blue grass, and many others. Metal however, always holds a special place in my heart as
the spark that ignited my passion for making music</p>

<p>I have been involved in game design in one form or another for about 10 years. I started designing modules for
tabletop roleplaying games, beginning with Advanced Dungeons &amp Dragons, 2nd Edition. As my programing skills
increase, I have begun working on PC games. I still run a weekly Pathfinder group in my home town of Ephrata,
Pennsylvania.</p>
