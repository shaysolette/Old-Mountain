<p>I'm tired.  My horse is tired.  I've been riding since before dawn, and now the sun has slipped almost
completely below the horizon.  I can see the lantern lights of a town up ahead.  Old Mountain.  A shit hole
town I usually try to avoid. My mouth is dry and parched.  The breeze begins to pick up, swirling tiny
cyclones of dust and grit through the dry, frigid desert air. I fukin' hate the desert at night. I fukin' hate
the desert all the time.  Hell, on days like today I just hate everything.  Life is cheaper than one legged
whore here in the outer territories.</p>
<p>As the wind begins to pick up, I pull a bandanna up over my face to keep the grit out of my teeth.  My horse
begins to fidget.  As I approach the outskirts of town, the deputy standing watch shines his lantern in my
direction.  He looks at me, and then he looks at the dead man draped over the back of my horse and he just
nods. I continue onwards.  I approach the bar.   The sign out front says "The Flying Unicorn". What a joke.  I
spit in the dirt, and dismount from my horse.  I tie her up out front and head into the bar.  When I walk
through the door, the piano music stops and everyone looks at me.</p>
<p>"Sheriff's over there" The door man nods toward the man siting alone, feet propped up on the table, wide
brimmed hat drawn down over his face.  He slouches back in his chair, and appears to be napping.  I walk over,
and kick the leg of the chair he is sitting in.  He looks up, adjusting his hat. He glares at me for a few
seconds while running his hand over his ridiculous handlebar mustache.</p>
<p>"Here to collect another bounty?" I nod. "You know", he continues, "one of these days your luck is going to
run out." He reaches into his duster, and pulls out a bag of coins, throwing them onto the table in front of
him. "There's thirty pieces of silver in there", he says, "the price for a man's life". I nod, and take the
bag. Ones man's life is another man's dinner, and a roof to sleep under from time to time.  This condescending
prick really gets on my nerves.</p>
<p>"What you want I should do with the body?" I ask, nodding towards the door.  "It's beginning to grow
putrid, and emitting a fetid odor.  It'll start to attract all kinds O nasty critters soon if it gets left
out."  Really I just want the damn thing off my horse.  She deserves better than that.  I could give a care
less if wind kind of vermin want to chew on the thing.  I'll just go retrieve my two crossbow bolts from it's
rib cage.</p>
<p>"Put it in a box." replies the sheriff. "I'll have the undertaker take care of it in the morning."  Sure
you will.  Lazy good for nothing.   I walk over to the bar and pull up a stool.  I toss a few coins on the
bar.  The busty barmaid glares at me for a few seconds, and then scoops up the coins.  I tell her to have
Carlo go out and get the rotting corpse of my Buttercup, and then I order rye biscuits and a glass of
whiskey.</p>
<p>After enjoying my meal in relative silence, I notice a bit of commotion beginning to stir across the bar. I
look up, two see two busty women, clad in little but corsets and garters, enjoying the company of each others
tongues inside each others faces.  The men at the bar, silent up to this point, begin to whoop and holler. One
of the men reaches for the women, but before he can do anything else, the woman closest to him slaps his had
away, but this only seems to make him even more determined to put his hands were they don't belong. He
reaches for her again, and this time is rewarded with a handful of breast.  The woman screams, and tries to
push the drunkard off of her, but to no avail.</p>
<p>I role my eyes, and stand up from my stool.  Time to play the reluctant hero again.  My hand reaches for
the hilt of the short sword I always keep at my side.  I prefer to use my crossbow were I can, but quarters
are a bit close for shooting at the moment I judge. After drawing my sword, I slam the hilt on the bar a few
times like a gavel to get everyones attention.  The trio of leering drunkards that is now surrounding these
two lovely prostitutes looks over at me.</p>
<p>"No freebies" I say. They glare at me with hate in there eyes, and begin to move towards me.  They are a
bit unsteady on their feet, and, I can already tell, no match for me.  All the same, I think I will try to
avoid spilling their guts out all over the floor.  I'd hate for the barmaid to have to clean that up.  I would
have to leave her a tip for her trouble.</p>
<p>As the three men move to surround me, I quickly act, striking the man closest to my left, my sword hand,
with the pommel of my sword, square in the temple.  I quickly reverse my swing and deliver the same blow to
the man on my right, sending them both howling to the floor.  This leaves just one, our groper friend,
standing before me. I hold my blade up under his chin. "Do you really want to try me?"</p>
<p>He quickly shakes his head no. "Leave", I say, "now". I point towards the door with my sword, and watch him
back away. After he is gone, I walk over to the ladies. "Are you okay?" I ask, putting my hand on the shoulder
of the one he assaulted. She looks me over for a moment, smiles a bit, and motions for me to sit down next
her. Her "friend" smiles at me as well, and sends me a wink. I take her up on her offer to sit with them, and
order another round of whiskey for myself, and for the ladies as well.  They look like whiskey kinda galls.
Suites me just fine.</p>
<p>"I don't want to interrupt anything with you and your lady friend there" I say."<p>
<p>"Oh, you know better than that" the one closest to me replies. "That's just an act to help us get
business".</p>
<p>"A gals gotta do what a gals gotta do" I say, and I raise my glass.  We each take a drink before I ask "So,
what are your names?"
<p>"I'm Sandy" the one closest to me replies, "and this here is Kate", she says, pointing to her friend.</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to meet you ladies" I say, tipping my hat. "Call me Lee".</p>
<p>"Nice to meet you Lee" they both say in unison. 
<p>"Not to be ungrateful" says Sandy, "But you know you didn't have to do all that.  We have ways of dealing
with that sort of thing." Her eyes moved towered something I couldn't quite make out, tucked into her
garter.</p>
<p>"I know", I said, "But I just really felt the need to crack some sculls. Say, it's been a long day, and
it's getting mighty late.  What say we all retire for the evening?"  I slide them each several pieces of
silver. Sandy grins widely.<p>
</p>"I thought you'd never ask" she says. I get up and push in my stool.  I leave a small tip on the bar, and
walk over toward the stairs, behind where the sheriff is sitting.</p>
<p>"I'll be seeing you in the jackass" I say to the sheriff as I walk past. "And thanks for your help with
those limp dicks over there" I add. The girls get up and follow me up the stairs, and I head to my usual room
at the end of the hall.  It aint much, but It's a roof over my head, and a bed to fuck in.  I close the
curtain, close the door, turn down the oil lamp, and me and my lady friends climb into the bed.  Needless to
say, I don't get as much sleep as could have.
